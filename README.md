# Fluorescence


This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks for processing fluorescence signals/images.

1. Axon_Length_Area_Calculation.ipynb    
- reports the lengths and areas of four different axons.   

2. Edge_Detection.ipynb   
- detects and colors the contour lines of spreaded responses.   

3. Light_Intensity_Detection.ipynb
- captures depolarization or hyperpolarization phenomena.
